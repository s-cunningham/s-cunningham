- 👋 Hi, I’m @s-cunningham
- 👀 I’m interested in wildlife ecology, population modeling, survival analysis, and machine learning (especially in context of behavior classification from accelerometer data). 
- 🌱 I predominately use R for analysis, but am starting to learn Python. Got any tips or good resources?
