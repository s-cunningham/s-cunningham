- 👋 Hi, I’m @s-cunningham
- 👀 I’m interested in wildlife ecology, population modeling, survival analysis, and machine learning (especially in context of behavior classification from accelerometer data). 
- :mortar_board: I am currently in my final year as a PhD student. 
- 🌱 I predominately use R for analysis, but am starting to learn Python. Got any tips or good resources?
- :computer: Currently, my repositories are marked as private as I work on my dissertation research, but plan to switch them to public once the manuscripts reach publication stage.
